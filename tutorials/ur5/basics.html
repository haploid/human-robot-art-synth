        <p>Hitting the big red button stops the robot. A message will pop up on
        the screen. To get the robot moving again first rotate the red button
        in the direction of the arrows until it pops out. Then dismiss the
        popups and reinitialize the robot if necessary.</p>

        <h2>Common Issues</h2>

        <h3>Singularities</h3>

        <p>Singularities are points where the robot tries to move a joint
        infinitely fast in order to maintain a constraint on its motion, like
        linearity or constant speed. The robot cannot move infinitely fast
        (thank the Gods) so when a singularity is encountered the robot will
        generally hit its speed limit and stop. Though sometimes it just moves
        near to a singularity, in which case unexpectedly fast motion may
        result.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of a singularity in vertical motion:</p>

        <figure>
          <label for="singularity_vertical" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="singularity_vertical" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">The "elbow" joint experiences the
            singularity here. Watch the popping motion as it accelerates to its
            limit.</span>
          <img src="/images/singularity_vertical.gif"></img>
        </figure>

        <p>And here is a singularity in the horizontal direction:</p>

        <figure>
          <label for="singularity_horizontal" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label>
          <input type="checkbox" id="singularity_horizontal" class="margin-toggle">
          <span class="marginnote">Note that in this case the robot was unable
            to maintain a constant speed, but it succeeded in keeping its
            motion along the intended path.</span>
          <img src="/images/singularity_horizontal.gif"></img>
        </figure>

        <p>While driving the robot from the PolyScope UI on the pendant the most likely place to encounter this kind of problem is the "Move Tool" section under the "Move" tab:</p>

        <figure>

        </figure>

        <h3>Collisions</h3>

        <img src="/images/collision.gif"></img>

        <p>Sometimes the robot hits things or itself or people (hopefully
        rarely). The UR5 is what is known as a collaborative robot - it is
        designed to be used in close proximity to people. This means that it
        incorporates safety features that minimize the risks associated with it
        unexpectedly hitting something. Every joint has force feedback and if
        at any moment the expected force exceeds safety margins the robot will
        come to an immediate stop. A popup will appear on the screen and it
        must be dismissed before the robot can continue operating.</p>

        <p>Though the robot is generally safe to work with please stay alert and
        use common sense. It's still possible to get conked in the head or in
        another vulnerable spot. And the robot may be carrying a tool that
        comes with its own safety concerns, such as a knife or laser. Treat it
        with at least the respect that you would give any power tool in a
        shop.</p>
